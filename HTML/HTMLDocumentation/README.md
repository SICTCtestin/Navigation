This will allow you to understand how to change imageView's image through button onclicks

## JavaScript Code

Put this in a section called script to make the button change the image on the map

Make sure to put the id of the imageView in the getElementById so it can be changed

Put the source of the image you want to change to in the img.src

 ## HTML Code
Then you need to make sure the buttons are calling the function by putting them in an onclick event
