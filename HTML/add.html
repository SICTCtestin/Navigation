                <h3>COURSE DESCRIPTION:</h3>
                <p>
                    These courses introduce students to the fundamentals of design and aspects of the fields of civil engineering and architecture. Throughout the course, students will manipulate computer-aided design (CAD) software to design and create plans associated with a residential and commercial structure. Application of basic design principles associated with discipline-specific fields of architecture and concepts of civil engineering will be used in their design. This course will emphasize the environmental impact of a structure and the building process, treatment of water sources before, during, and after the construction of a structure, building construction, surveying, universally compliant building design, calculations associated with the building process, introduction to basic mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEP) systems concepts within a building and the application of building codes as established at the local, state and national levels.
                    
                    This course runs at the same time and concurrent to the Project Lead the Way: Civil Engineering and Architecture course/curriculum.
