                <h3>COURSE DESCRIPTION:</h3>
                <p>
                    The SPET Aerial Systems course is designed to meet the needs of growing industry demand in the fields of engineering, architecture, electronics, surveying, inspection, and photography.  Within a one-year course, students will experience and gain knowledge associated with small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) in the areas of flight operations, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations, safety, design, engineering, construction, testing protocols and various topics associated with photography and photogrammetry.  As such, students will be able to gain an industry recognized certification (FAA Part 107 Remote Pilot Certificate) and skills that will translate to a four-year degree pathway at two Indiana public colleges or directly into one of the growing fields within the industry.

Currently this course is a pilot program for the Indiana Department of Education.

Required Grade Level: 12
