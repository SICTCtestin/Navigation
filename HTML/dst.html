                <h3>COURSE DESCRIPTION:</h3>
                <p>Diesel Service Technology is a two year course designed for high school juniors and seniors. The training program is Master Accredited by ASE/NATEF. Areas of Accreditation include Diesel Engines, Drive Train, Electrical/Electronic Systems, Brakes, Heating & Air Conditioning, Preventive Maintenance Inspection, and Suspension & Steering. We cover all the systems on a vehicle, not just engines.

                    Training is divided between the classroom and lab. We are equipped with high quality tools and equipment for the students to learn with. They will have access to internet based factory service information. We use the same systems that technicians in the field use. 
                    
                    Employers today are looking for more than hands-on technical skills. They need an employee with computer skills, communication skills, the ability to write effectively, get along with other employees & supervisors, work with customers, etc. All of these skills will be addressed.
